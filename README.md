## Preamble
- üë©‚Äçüî¨ I‚Äôm interested in developing computational tools and applying statistical methods, and cutting-edge technologies (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) for integrating, managing and analyzing high-dimensional genomics data to unravel true associations and molecular underpinnings of complex and rare diseases
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical research
- üíûÔ∏è I am excited by big, complex and messy data that ends up into beautiful and meaningful visualizations that help us derive actionable insights and new hypotheses for the acceleration of translational and precision medicine üíÉ

## Background:

I come from an IT background that heavily revolved around working with computer networks, information systems, programming and working with databases. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology and a Master's degree in Information Technology; however, I still seemed to be inclined to Biology!!!. My love for Biology drove me into Bioinformatics and I am loving it!! :smile: I currently hold a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics and working my way towards my PhD in machine learning and artificial intelligence for biomedical research.

## Research
[<img align ="left" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe/blob/master/Plugins/gif1.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe/blob/master/Plugins/gif1.gif)
My [previous research](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0377717), conducted in the cool Shah Lab, revolved around triple negative breast cancers, the most aggresive, complex, heterogenous and hard to treat form of breast cancer, which unfortunately is more prevalent in younger patients. I conducted research to stratify triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), and to improve our understanding of this complex disease. This work was accomplished by developing and applying computational, statistical and database driven approaches to analyze and visualize large-scale whole genome profiles of samples from TNBC patients; research that discovered for the first time and to the best of our knowledge, five genomic and clinically distinct TNBC subgroups, revealed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, based on mutation signatures, and somatic mutations (at all scales) in patient genomes; this research resulted into [award-winning tools](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/bioinformatics-student-rebecca-asiimwe-wins-2018-19-data-science-award) for the management, analysis and visualization of whole-genome profiling data and showed for the utility of the genome as a potential discriminant
biomarker in patient treatment.

I am currently placed in the awesome Kobor Lab where I conduct statistical and bioinformatics analyses of high-throughput epigenomics and genotyping data, to facilitate the interpretation of associations between molecular data, the environment, and disease.

## Why ML and AI 
Current advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to the generation of vast amounts of sequencing data that has augmented our understanding of human variation and disease. However, the production of these large and high dimensional datasets, coupled with confounding factors, and the heterogeneity of features under investigation, presents significant challenges in unravelling true associations and the molecular underpinnings of disease. Leveraging the powerful opportunities presented by machine learning and artificial intelligence in analyzing large and complex high-dimensional multiomics data supports the elucidation of mutational landscapes and molecular correlations of complex and rare diseases at higher precisions.
